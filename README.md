Real-Time Interactive UI for 3DOF Robotic Arm
The real-time interactive user interface (UI) is the gateway between the physical robotic arm and its digital control system, enabling seamless operation, monitoring, and automation with precision and ease.

ðŸŒŸ Key Features
âœ… Intuitive Control: Easily maneuver the robotic arm with a user-friendly interface.
âœ… Automation (Auto Mode): Record and replay movement sequencesâ€”perfect for production line tasks.
âœ… Powerful Presets System: Save, reuse, and share movement sequences effortlessly.

ðŸ”§ The 3DOF Robotic Arm Project
This project combines cutting-edge mechanical design, software development, and automation to create a precise, efficient, and user-friendly robotic system.

Mechanical Design: Built with SolidWorks & Fusion 360, ensuring a durable yet lightweight structure capable of handling 1.8 kg payloads.
Smooth Motion Control: C++ & ROS2 integration delivers fluid and responsive movement.
Interactive UI: Provides an intuitive and efficient way to operate and automate the robotic arm.
This project is a step towards making robotic automation more accessible and efficientâ€”whether for industrial tasks, research, or learning!
